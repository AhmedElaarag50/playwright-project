# üéÆ Playwright Project: Web Scraper for Steam Specials

This project is a web scraper built using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) and [Selectolax](https://github.com/lexbor/selectolax) to extract promotional game data from the Steam Store or any similar site. It programmatically navigates the page, extracts the required HTML content, parses it, and saves structured data into a CSV file.

## üöÄ Features

- Automates browser interactions using Playwright.
- Extracts specific HTML sections using custom CSS selectors.
- Parses game information and processes raw attributes.
- Saves cleaned data as a structured CSV file.
- Modular and configurable setup.
